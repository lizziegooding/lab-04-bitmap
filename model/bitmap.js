// bitmap constructor
// contains methods for transforming the color array

// * Your project should have three transforms
//   * Invert the colors (essentially subtract every color value from the max color value which is 255),
//   * Grayscale the colors - Google it.
//   * (red|green|blue)scale the colors, same as above but only multiply one of the colors.
